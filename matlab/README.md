> **Note:**
> - The MATLAB section only demonstrates the basic behavior of an H.264 encoder. It does **not** accurately represent the internal workings of the hardware encoder used in this project.
> - Encoding results are limited to a 416Ã—240 test video due to long simulation times and lack of performance optimization.
